# rockpaperverus (WIP)

This is a tmi.js bot that will ideally allow users in twitch chat to challenge each other to a game of rock-paper-scissors.
It requires the user to make a constants file with a twitch bot's api key and channels for it to view.
This is a work in progress as you can likely guess and I'm still learning async-io and javascript, but it's been fun so far!
